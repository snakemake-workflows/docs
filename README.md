# The Snakemake-Workflows project

The Snakemake-workflows project is a joint effort to create workflows for common use cases of the [Snakemake workflow management system](https://snakemake.bitbucket.io).


## Workflows

A list of all available workflows that are currently in development can be found [here](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows).

### Approved workflows

The following workflows have undergone a strict review and quality control process and are ready for production. They can be considered as **best practice examples**.

| Workflow | Domain | Authors |

| [rna-seq-star-deseq2](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/rna-seq-star-deseq2) | RNA-seq | Johannes Köster (https://koesterlab.github.io) |
| [rna-seq-kallisto-sleuth](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/rna-seq-kallisto-sleuth) | RNA-seq | Johannes Köster (https://koesterlab.github.io) |
| [dna-seq-gatk-variant-calling](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/dna-seq-gatk-variant-calling) | DNA-seq | Johannes Köster (https://koesterlab.github.io)
| [dna-seq-varlociraptor](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/dna-seq-varlociraptor) | DNA-seq | Johannes Köster, Felix Mölder (https://koesterlab.github.io)
| [accel-amplicon-trimming](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/accel-amplicon-trimming) | Accel Amplicon | Patrik Smeds (Clinical Genomics Uppsala) |
| [single-cell-rna-seq](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/single-cell-rna-seq) | Single cell RNA-seq | Johannes Köster (https://koesterlab.github.io) |

## Documentation

### Join the team

Once the initiators have agreed on the procedure, it will be possible to join the team here.

### Contribute

Contributing is easy:

1. Join the team
2. Create a new repository for your workflow
3. Ensure that your workflow meets our guidelines.
3. Request a review [here](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/docs/issues).

### Guidelines

1. A workflow repository shall consist of one Snakemake workflow.
2. The structure of the workflow should follow our [template](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/cookiecutter-snakemake-workflow). You can create a new workflow with [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) via `cookiecutter gh:snakemake-workflows/cookiecutter-snakemake-workflow`.
3. Whenever possible, [Snakemake wrappers](https://snakemake-wrappers.readthedocs.io) should be used.
4. The workflow should be configurable via a well documented YAML-based configuration file and (when necessary) a sample and a unit sheet (see [here](https://github.com/snakemake-workflows/rna-seq-star-deseq2) for an example).
5. The workflow has to define an (integration-style) test case that is configured via the `.travis.yml` file in the skeleton.
6. For inclusion in the [snakemake workflow catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog/), further follow [the catalog inclusion requirements](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-workflow-catalog?rules=true).
